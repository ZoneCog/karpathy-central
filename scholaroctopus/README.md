# ScholarOctopus

ScholarOctopus is a set of tools/pages that help explore academic literature. Currently, ScholarOctopus is a collection of pointers to 7000 papers from 34 Computer Vision and Machine Learning conferences (CVPR/ICCV/NIPS/ICML/ECCV/BMVC) between 2006 and 2014.

## Visualizations

The first visualization I wrote for this data is to compute bigram tfidf vectors and embed them with t-SNE in 2D. The visualization can be found [here](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/scholaroctopus/). The page contains a few more links to stats and some pointer data.

If you'd like to write your own visualization "view" of the data, I warmly welcome additional contributions, likely in form of another `.html` file, or a patch to the current main file `render/index.html`.
